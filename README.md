# Enable and extend Jupyter Notebooks for Greenplum Database environments

## Install Greenplum Sandbox VM
Download the [Greenplum Sandbox VM](https://greenplum.org/gpdb-sandbox-tutorials/) before moving forward to the next steps. Read throught the instructions and tutorials available on **[greenplum.org](https://greenplum.org/)** on how to enable, connect to and start your Greenplum Database. SSH to your Greenplum Database.

## Ensure you can run Python from the command line
Before you go any further, make sure you have Python and that the expected version is available from your command line. You can check this by running:

```shell
$ python --version
```
  
You should get some output like `Python 2.7.12.`. 
  
## Ensure you can run *pip* from the command line 
Additionally, you’ll need to make sure you have pip available. You can check this by running:

```shell
$ pip --version
```

If `pip` isn’t already installed, then first try to bootstrap it from the standard library:

```shell
$ python -m ensurepip --default-pip
```

If that still doesn’t allow you to run pip:

- Securely Download [get-pip.py](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py)[^1].
- Run `python get-pip.py`[^2]. This will install or upgrade *pip*. Additionally, it will install *setuptools* and *wheel* if they’re not installed already.

| **Warning:** | 
| :--- |
| Be cautious if you’re using a Python install that’s managed by your operating system or another package manager. get-pip.py does not coordinate with those tools, and may leave your system in an inconsistent state. You can use `python get-pip.py --prefix=/usr/local/` to install in `/usr/local` which is designed for locally-installed software. |

## Ensure pip, setuptools, and wheel are up to date

While *pip* alone is sufficient to install from pre-built binary archives, up to date copies of the *setuptools* and *wheel* projects are useful to ensure you can also install from source archives:

```shell
$ python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
```

## Ensure ipython-sql & psycopg2 are up to date

You must also install the Python SQL packages with the *pip* tool. You may achieve that by executing the following in the command-line:

```shell
$ pip install --upgrade ipython-sql psycopg2-binary
```

## Install Jupyter Notebooks with pip

Install the Jupyter Notebook using:

```shell
$ pip install jupyter
```

Congratulations. You have installed Jupyter Notebook. 

## Start a Jupyter Notebook Server for the first time

You can start running a notebook server from the command line using the following command:

```shell
$ jupyter notebook
```

This will print some information about the notebook server in your console, and open a web browser to the URL of the web application (by default, `http://127.0.0.1:8888`).

## Configure the Jupyter Notebook Server using the Command-Line options

The notebook server can be run with a variety of command line arguments.

### To open a specific Jupyter Notebook

The following code should open the given notebook in the currently running notebook server, starting one if necessary.

```shell
$ jupyter notebook notebook.ipynb
```

### To start the Jupyter Notebook using a custom IP or port
By default, the notebook server starts on port 8888. If port 8888 is unavailable or in use, the notebook server searches the next available port. You may also specify a port and an IP manually. In this example, we set the server’s port to 9999 and the server's IP to 10.0.2.45:

```shell
$ jupyter notebook --port 9999 -ip "10.0.2.15"
```

### To get help about Jupyter Notebook server options
The full list of available options can be found [here](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html#options) or can be generated by running the following command:

```shell
$ jupyter notebook --help
```

<!--
The landing page of the Jupyter notebook web application, the **dashboard**, shows the notebooks currently available in the notebook directory (by default, the directory from which the notebook server was started).

You can create new notebooks from the dashboard with the `New Notebook` button, or open existing ones by clicking on their name. You can also drag and drop `.ipynb` notebooks and standard `.py` Python source code files into the notebook list area.

When starting a notebook server from the command line, you can also open a particular notebook directly, bypassing the dashboard, with `jupyter notebook my_notebook.ipynb`. The `.ipynb` extension is assumed if no extension is given.

When you are inside an open notebook, the *File* | *Open…* menu option will open the dashboard in a new browser tab, to allow you to open another notebook from the notebook directory or to create a new notebook.
-->

## Running a public Jupyter Notebook Server

If you want to access your notebook server remotely via a web browser, you can do so by running a public notebook server. For optimal security when running a public notebook server, you should first secure the server with a password and/or SSL/HTTPS as described in [Securing a notebook server](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/public_server.html#notebook-server-security).

| **Important** |
| :--- |
| This is not the multi-user server you are looking for. This document describes how you can run a public server with a single user. This should only be done by someone who wants remote access to their personal machine. Even so, doing this requires a thorough understanding of the set-ups limitations and security implications. If you allow multiple users to access a notebook server as it is described in this document, their commands may collide, clobber and overwrite each other.
If you want a multi-user server, the official solution is [JupyterHub](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). To use JupyterHub, you need a Unix server (typically Linux) running somewhere that is accessible to your users on a network. This may run over the public internet, but doing so introduces additional [security concerns](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/security-basics.html). |

Check to see if you have a notebook configuration file, `jupyter\_notebook\_config.py`. The default location for this file is your Jupyter folder located in your home directory, which for Linux systems is `/home/$USERNAME/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py`. If you don’t already have a Jupyter folder, or if your Jupyter folder doesn’t contain a notebook configuration file, run the following command - This command will create the Jupyter folder if necessary, and create notebook configuration file, `jupyter_notebook_config.py`, in this folder.

```shell
$ jupyter notebook --generate-config
```

### Automatic Password setup
As of notebook 5.3, the first time you log-in using a token, the notebook server should give you the opportunity to setup a password from the user interface. You will be presented with a form asking for the current *token*, as well as your *new password*; enter both and click on __Login and setup new password**. Next time you need to log in you’ll be able to use the new password instead of the login token, otherwise follow the procedure to set a password from the command line.

Starting at notebook version 5.0, you can enter and store a password for your notebook server with a single command. jupyter notebook password will prompt you for your password and record the hashed password in your `jupyter_notebook_config.json`.

```shell
$ jupyter notebook password
Enter password:  ****
Verify password: ****
[NotebookPasswordApp] Wrote hashed password to ~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.json
```

This can be used to reset a lost password; or if you believe your credentials have been leaked and desire to change your password. Changing your password will invalidate all logged-in sessions after a server restart.

### Configure the Jupyter Notebook Server using the `jupyter_notebook_config.json` file

The same configuration parameters for which we previously used the command-line can also be configured on the `jupyter_notebook_config.json` file. Simply update the file with the appropriate configuration key-value pairs, for example as shown below:

```json
{
  "NotebookApp": {
    "password": "sha1:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
    "ip": "10.0.2.15",
    "notebook_dir": "/home/gpadmin/jupyter/",
    "open_browser": false,
    "port": 9999
  }
}

```

## Install Jupyter Notebook Extensions

Run the following in a command prompt:

```shell
$ pip install jupyter_contrib_nbextensions && jupyter contrib nbextension install 
```

## Enable *Snippets* Jupyter Notebook Extension

- Start up a Jupyter Notebook 

![img](jupyter-files.png "Jupyter Notebook")

- Navigate to the new Nbextensions tab

![img](jupyter-nbextensions.png "Jupyter Notebook Extensions")

- Enable Jupyter Notebook *Snippets* Extension. 

![img](jupyter-snippets.png "Jupyter Notebook Snippet Extension")

- This extension adds a drop-down menu to the IPython toolbar that allows easy insertion of code snippet cells into the current notebook. 

![img](snippets-demo.gif "Jupyter Notebook Snippet Extension Demo")

## Add a Greenplum Database snippet
Snippets are specified by adding a new JSON block to the list of existing snippets in `$`. For example, to add a new snippet that connects to a Greenplum database and prints its version, the JSON file should be modified from:

```json
{
    "snippets" : [
        {
            "name" : "example",
            "code" : [
                "# This is an example snippet!",
                "# To create your own, add a new snippet block to the",
                "# snippets.json file in your jupyter data directory under nbextensions:",
                "# $(jupyter --data-dir)/nbextensions/snippets/snippets.json",
                "import this"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

to this:

```json
{
    "snippets" : [
        {
            "name" : "GPDB-version",
            "code" : [
                "%load_ext sql",
                "%sql postgres://gpadmin:pivotal@localhost:5432/gpadmin",
                "version = %sql SELECT version()",
                "version"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
You may need to restart your notebook for the changes to take effect.
